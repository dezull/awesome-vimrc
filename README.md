# Awesome vimrc

## Install

    $ git clone https://github.com/dezull/awesome-vimrc.git ~/.vim_runtime
    $ sh ~/.vim_runtime/install.sh
    $ cp ~/.vim_runtime/my_configs.dist.vim ~/.vim_runtime/my_configs.vim

## A Little Background

Most stuff here originally comes from the already awesome [amix's vimrc](https://github.com/amix/vimrc). I modified it to use [vim plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug). These days I do mostly Ruby & Javascript, so I have added stuff that I use, and have removed some that I don't. So it is pretty opinionated now.

## Configuration Files

You should be able to modify most stuff in `my_configs.vim`. If not, just fork this repository.

- `vimrcs/plugins_config.vim` - Configurations for plugins in `vimrcs/plug.vim`. I have documented what they do and some key mappings there.
- `vimrcs/basic.vim` - Basic configuration.
- `vimrcs/extended.vim` - Extended configuration.
